# SensorNav-Android
My goal was to build an Android application (proof of concept) that helps visually impaired people navigate in closed environments using BLE sensor beacons (configured to iBeacon standard).

Using an equation derived after testing Received Signal Strength Identifier values at various distances, the approximate distance to a beacon can be calculated.
